# Advent of Code 2023 – Solutions

## Notes

### Day 05

The step 2 is a bruteforce stupid solution.
Had to wait for around ~5–7 minutes to have the answer.
Launched it on:

```
openjdk version "21" 2023-09-19 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21+35 (build 21+35-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21+35 (build 21+35-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
```

```
OS: EndeavourOS Linux x86_64
Host: 20UES00H00 ThinkPad T14 Gen 1
Kernel: 6.6.7-arch1-1
DE: GNOME 45.2
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 4650U with Radeon Graphics (12) @ 2.100GHz
GPU: AMD ATI Radeon RX Vega 6
Memory: 11889MiB / 31316MiB
```

### Day 21

Used [this approach from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18nevo3/comment/keaiiq7/).
The code implementation is mine, but the idea has been taken from that thread on Reddit.

### Day 24

The following comments from Reddit were helpful for me:

* [Comment 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18pnycy/comment/keqf8uq/)
* [Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18pnycy/comment/kesv56w/)

The general idea is not mine. However, implementation is mine.
